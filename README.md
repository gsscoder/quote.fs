# QuoteFs

F# library for querying real time stock market data including indexes such as NASDAQ and the S&P500. This is a replacement for [YFinance.fs](https://github.com/gsscoder/yfinance.fs), since Yahoo service on which it's based is now shutdown. It gathers data from [Financial Modeling Prep](https://financialmodelingprep.com/).

## Build and run the CLI app

**NOTE**: .NET Core 3.0 or higher is required.
```sh
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/gsscoder/quote.fs.git

# build the CLI app
$ paket install && dotnet restore
$ cd quote.fs/src/QuoteFs
$ dotnet build -c release

# execute the CLI app
./artifacts/QuoteFs.CLI/Release/netcoreapp3.0/quote --help
quote 0.1.0-pre
Copyright Â© Giacomo Stelluti Scala, 2019

  -s, --symbol    Prints detail of stock quote (identified by its symbol)

  --help          Display this help screen.

  --version       Display version information.
```

## C# Sample

`Query` static class is provided to supply a more convenient **C#** interface. You can use [CSharpx](https://github.com/gsscoder/csharpx) to consume in a more accessible and functional way `FSharpResult<T, TError>` type from **C#**.

```csharp
using CSharpx.FSharp;
using QuoteFs;

foreach (var ticker in Query.MajorIndexes) {
    var result = Query.GetIndex(ticker);
    result.March(
        index => Console.WriteLine($"{index.Name} {index.Price}"),
        error => Console.WriteLine($"Trouble: {error}"));
}
```
